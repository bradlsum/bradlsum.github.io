            <h1>Calculator</h1>
            <h2>Fall 2018</h2>
            <p>A simple scientific calculator written in JavaScript. The calculator calls a single function for each number key and operator key to add numbers and operators to the string being manipulated. Upon pressing the enter key, the calculator evaluates the string using a built in function in JavaScript and displays the output in the text field.

            <h1>Arduino Proximity Detector</h1>
            <h2>Spring 2018</h2>
            <p>This Project is used to measure distance between it and other objects in front of it. It is built on a Arduino Uno and primarily uses an ultrasonic sensor for input detection along with a button that is used to check if the Arduino board is still being held. The Arduino has two buzzers that are used to signal how far away a object is by buzzing at different rates. Fast for close and slow for further away. If the Arduino is dropped the button will is no longer held down causing the buzzers to emit a constant noise altering the user to its location. See the <a href="https://github.com/bradlsum/IOT-Arduino-project">Github prjoct</a> here.</p>
