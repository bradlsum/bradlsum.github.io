        <h1>mEEL Time!</h1>

        <img src="../../images/mEEL%20TimePNG.PNG" style="width: 33%; float: right;">
        <p>mEEL Time is a collection of fast-paced restaurant based minigames that users must accomplish based on a
            prompt instructing them to do various tasks. Users will be given scores based on how fast they can
            accomplish each task and will lose points if they fail a task.
            In mEEL Time you play as Neelson who has just started a new job at the fanciest restaurant in town. The only
            problem is, Neelson doesn’t have hands! Help Neelson take orders, cook food and clean up the kitchen during
            rush hour and keep his job!
        </p>
        <p>
            mEEL Time is being developed in Unreal Engine 4 for Windows 10. mEEL Time is scheduled to release a finished
            prototype in the winter of 2018.
        </p>

        <h1>Prototype Fall 2018</h1>
        <p>This is the prototype build for the Game Desigin class at University of Colorado Denver fall 2018, It
            contains two more minigames than the last build as well as models for its assets.</p>

        <h2>Minigame Descriptions</h2>
        <p>Each minigame is five seconds long with a three second break before each game. During the break the user will
            receive a prompt of what they are supposed to do in each minigame. All of the minigames are played with a
            mouse as input and take advantage of the mouse’s x axis as well as left click.</p>
        <h3>Game 1:</h3>
        <p>The first minigame is a balance game. The goal is for the user to keep as many of the items on their tray
            while the tray becomes increasingly harder to keep balanced. The player moves there mouse to the left or the
            right to try an offset set the tipping plater. With each second that passes the rate at which the plater
            tries to flip itself gets greater by a factor of a third. Players will be scored based on how many items
            have not fall after five seconds.</p>
        <h3>Game 2:</h3>
        <p>The second minigame is a matching game. For the first second of the game the user has a few items shown to
            them before they disappear. The user then has to find the items on a shelf in the remaining time and select
            them with the left mouse button. The user will be scored positively for each correct item they select and
            negatively for each item that was not shown to the at the beginning.</p>
        <h3>Game 3:</h3>
        <p>The third minigame is a catching game. The user takes control of a plate that they must use to catch items
            falling down toward the plate. The user controls the plate by moving the mouse side to side. The user will
            be scored positively for each item they can catch on the plate during the five second game time.</p>

        <h1>Level of Completion</h1>
        <p>The game has reached its desired level of completion for this semester. It has one less game than originally
            intended which was left out due to time constraints. The next steps for this project would be to add a level
            of variation in each minigame so that each game plays differently each time you play it. Another future goal
            would be to port mEEL Time! to mobile platforms were the player could use other kinds of input to add to the
            level of immersion in mEEL Time!.</p>

        <h1>Challenges</h1>
        <p>There were several challenge to making ‘mEEL Time!’ that put production a little behind schedule. The largest
            of those challenges is how the user will have different camera views throughout the game. Between each
            minigame the camera must be changed to show the next game. By default Unreal Engine 4 prefers to snap the
            camera to any possessed pawns that the player controls which can change the player’s view from the camera
            that is setup for each minigame.</p>
        <p>The other major challenge was allowing the player to have multiple control types for each minigame. Since
            each minigame plays differently than the rest the players input has to managed throughout the game to ensure
            they are controlling the right minigame at the right time.</p>
