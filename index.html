            <p>My name is Sumner Bradley and this is my website! I am a quality and task driven person who enjoys a challenge. I look forward to learning new things and overcoming obstacles. I use this website to share my projects and learn about web design. There are links to some of my projects on this site and more on my GitHub which is linked below.</p>
            <h1>Academics</h1>
            <p>I am a senior computer science student at the University of Colorado Denver. I have studied many programming languages and am looking forward to learning many more. I am currently the most comfortable with C/C++, Java, and JavaScript. I am always looking for new challenges and things to learn to increase my skill set.</p>
            <h1>Profession</h1>
            <p>I have over four years of customer service experience as well as almost two years working as a supervisor. I love to work with people in a team environment to accomplish goals. I am moving into my field of study for my professional life and am eager to apply my teamwork and leadership skills that I have learned working with and supervising other people.</p>
